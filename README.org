* emacs-config-windows
  
  My minimal configuration for GNU Emacs on Windows.

* About

  This repository contains one Elisp file (~.emacs~) that should be placed in ~C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming~. This configuration is a heavily stripped down version of my [[https://github.com/nikhil-prabhu/emacs-config][main Emacs configuration]] and is configured to be as minimal as possible, while also having most of the functionality that I generally require. I made this configuration primarily for Windows, since my full-blown configuration is quite slow on Windows (due to Windows' poor performance with working with many small files).

  *NOTE:* I primarily work only with UNIX based operating systems (GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, etc.). I only use Windows when I'm forced to (like at work). This configuration is just a stand-by for when I have to use Emacs on Windows for some quick editing.

* Installation

  - Clone this repository to a directory on your local machine.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  > git clone https://github.com/nikhil-prabhu/emacs-config-windows
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  - Copy and paste the ~.emacs~ file in ~C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming~

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  > cp emacs-config-windows\.emacs C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming
  #+END_SRC
  
- Now start up GNU Emacs and wait for the required packages to be automatically installed. Once installation is finished, you may have a **Warnings** buffer show up, which you can ignore.

* Packages
